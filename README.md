# Work In Progress Notes

## End of project changes
- In the story holder, when saving our stories array (handleImageUpload function), we are using a temporary URL. This does not get 
saved in local storage. To save to local storage, we need to convert our url to base64 string. 
- need to constrain image dimensions to 1080x1920px

### current working on...
- handle deletion after time
- handle resetting loading bars when manually changing stories

### issues 
- none to report at the moment
